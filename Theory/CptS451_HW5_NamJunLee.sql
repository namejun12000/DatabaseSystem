1. a) minimal key for the relation: 
	Isolated: E
	Left: D
	Both: A
	Right: B,C,F
	Hence, DE.
   b) relation is not in BCNF because FD Aâ†’BC and D->AF
    is not trivial and does not have a superkey on its left-hand sides.
    Therefore, R(A,B,C,D,E,F) decompose into 
      relations R1(A,B,C), R3(A,D,F), and R4(D,E).

   c) A->BC is preserved in R1, D->AF is preserved in R3.

2. a) minimal keys for the relation:
	Isolated: None
	Left: B,C
	Both: A,D
	Right: None
	Hence, ABC & BCD.
   b) relation is not in BCNF because FD ADC->D has a superkey on its left hand side
	but FD D->A is not trivial and does not have a superkey on its left hand side
	Therefore, S(A,B,C,D) decompose into relations S1(A,D) and S2(B,C,D).
   c) D->A is preserved in S1, ABC->D is not preserved because no dependenices in decompose S2.
